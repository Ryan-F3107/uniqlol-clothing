# E-Commerce Clothing Store React Application
A clothing app developed (titled Uniqlol, inspired by Uniqlo) developed while learning about React Development, from an online Udemy course called "Complete React Developer in 2023 (w/ Redux, Hooks, GraphQL)".

## Project Description:
This application imitates your favorite clothing stores, with the ability to add items to the shopping cart. It contains items like shoes, hats, jackets, and so on, for men and women. Using the Stripe API, a mock credit card can be used to purchase your "items".

## Project Goal:
This project was worked on while learning about React. Hence, it contains a lot of code commented out,redone in a different way as progress was made. It also includes comments for my understanding. Working on this project is intended to get a better understanding of React and gain experience in front-end development.

### Dummy Credit Card:
```
Card Number: 4242424242424242
Expiry Date: any future date
Postal code: 4242424242
```
### To run the application on your computer
1) Clone the repository
2) Run npm install -> [ on command line ]
3) Run npm start

<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
